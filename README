Description
===========
Create an email service in Java using the Force.com Streaming API to send email through Amazon SES. 

Here's a high level overview of the application: "Emails" records will be inserted into a Custom Object in Salesforce along with any attachments. The Java application on heroku will use the Streaming API to "listen" for newly inserted email records. When a new record is detected, the Java application will grab all of it's information as well as any attachments and send the email to the recipient using Amazon SES.
